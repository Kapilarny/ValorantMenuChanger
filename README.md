# ValorantMenuChanger
Tool that allows you to customize your Valorant menu page!

# Installation
Click [here](https://github.com/Kapilarny/ValorantMenuChanger/releases/latest) to get to release page and download ValorantMenuChanger.exe and run it!

# Why does it exist
Basically you could just replace the video file BUT Valorant on startup automatically replaces that video file with the default one, so unless you want to run Valorant and than manually replace the video file every time, this tool is for you.

# Risks
### I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BAN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN USING THIS TOOL
There may be a little risk of getting a ban since it's not an official software from Riot Games, but as far as i know there is no bans for this type of thing right now (Dm me on Discord if you somehow get one)

# Building
#### If you want to build the project yourself you are gonna need atleast .Net Version v4.7.2 and Visual Studio.
Open ValorantMenuChanger.sln and run Release with Any CPU, the app should build and run and the path to it should be in ValorantMenuChanger/bin/Release/ValorantMenuChanger.exe
